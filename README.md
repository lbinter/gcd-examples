General Constrained Dynamics: models and papers
-----------------

General Constrained Dynamic (GCD) models extend the mathematical analogies between economics and classical mechanics from constrained optimization to constrained dynamics by formalizing economic (constraint) forces and economic power in analogy to physical (constraint) forces in Lagrangian mechanics. The models are based on a rigorous accounting framework, which guarantees a correct and comprehensive integration of all the flows and the stocks. In a differential-algebraic equation framework, households, firms, banks, and the government employ forces to change economic variables according to their desire and their power to assert their interest. These ex-ante forces are completed by constraint forces from unanticipated system constraints to yield the ex-post dynamics. The out-of-equilibrium models combine Keynesian concepts such as the balance sheet approach and slow adaptation of prices and quantities with bounded rationality (gradient climbing) discussed in behavioral economics and agent-based models. Depending on the power relations and adaptation speeds, the model converges to a neoclassical equilibrium or not. The framework integrates different schools of thought and overcomes some restrictions inherent to optimization approaches.

A number of papers have been written using GCD models.

This repository contains the `.gcd` files to construct some of the models using the [GCD Configurator](https://github.com/lbinter/gcd), while the `*.nb` files can be run directly in Mathematica.

  - Model `A1` (1 household, 1 firm, 1 good, without interest)
  - Model `A2` (1 household, 1 firm, 1 good, with accounts/debts and interest)
  - Model `B1` (1 household, 1 firm, 1 good, 1 banking system): Interest rate policy versus monetary policy
  - Model `B2` (1 household, 1 firm, 1 good, 1 bank, 1 central bank): Taylor rule
  - Model `C1` (1 household, 1 firm, 1 good, 1 banking system, 1 government): interest rate policy versus money supply policy
  - Model `C2 Taylor rule` (1 household, 1 firm, 1 good, 1 banking system, 1 government): standard Taylor rule
  - Model `D2` (comprehensive model)
  - Model `Keynes`: Different economic theories differ only by different assumptions about the power of agents
  - Model `SEN`: different economic theories differ in their assumptions about the endogeneity or exogeneity of different variables
  - Model `Fresssack`: Obesity or consumption / environment model
